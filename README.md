# Alzheimers_Predict
This R project utilizes logistic regression and decision tree to predict if someone will develop Alzheimers 


Alzheimer’s disease is a brain disorder that impairs an individual’s memory, cognitive functions, and eventually the ability to perform basic tasks. On a global scale, Alzheimer’s affects 55 million people and is currently ranked as the seventh leading cause of death. This analysis is important because Alzheimer’s disease impacts individuals on a wide scale. Therefore, these findings will allow us to identify predictors of Alzheimer’s and suggest preventive measures that could slow the progression and perhaps benefit the community.
